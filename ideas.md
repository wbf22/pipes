Hi! That sounds like a fun and useful project. Yes, you can definitely create a program to control your Ubuntu Linux computer remotely from your Raspberry Pi, capturing the screen and controlling the mouse and keyboard. Here's a general overview of how you could approach it:

1. **Set Up a Server on Your Ubuntu Machine**:
   - You can use tools like **VNC (Virtual Network Computing)** or **X11 forwarding** to share your screen.
   - Alternatively, you can create a custom server using Python (e.g., with `PyAutoGUI` for control and `pyscreenshot` for capturing the screen).

2. **Capture the Screen**:
   - Use Python libraries such as `PyScreenshot`, `mss`, or `PIL` to take screenshots.
   - Send these images over the network to your Raspberry Pi.

3. **Control Mouse and Keyboard**:
   - Use libraries like `PyAutoGUI`, `evdev`, or `xdotool` commands to simulate mouse and keyboard events on your Ubuntu machine.

4. **Create a Communication Protocol**:
   - Set up a socket connection (TCP/IP) between your Pi and your computer.
   - Send screen images as frames, and receive control commands for mouse and keyboard actions.

5. **Build the Client on Raspberry Pi**:
   - Create a simple GUI or command-line interface on your Pi to display the incoming screens.
   - Send control commands based on your inputs (e.g., mouse clicks, keyboard presses).

### Basic Example Concepts:
- **Server (on Ubuntu)**:
  - Continuously captures screenshots.
  - Listens for control commands from Pi.
  - Performs actions like moving the mouse or typing.

- **Client (on Pi)**:
  - Displays received screenshots.
  - Sends user input events back to server.

### Security Tip:
- Make sure to secure the connection, possibly with SSH tunneling or encryption, especially if you're controlling the system over your home network.

### Tips:
- Starting with VNC or similar might be easier initially.
- If you want a completely custom setup, Python is a good choice due to its rich libraries.
- Look into existing tools like **Synergy**, **Barrier**, or **Remote Desktop** options; they might simplify implementation.
